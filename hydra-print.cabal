name:                hydra-print
version:             0.1.0.2
synopsis:            NCurses interface to view multiple ByteString streams in parallel.
description: 

  Output from parallel subprocesses is an ugly, many-headed beast.
  Piping though hydra-print provides an NCurses interface to a dynamic
  set output streams, displayed without interleaving.  This is a
  common problem, for example, with parallel compiles, or
  data-processing scripts.
  .
  Specifically, this small library will split the screen when
  parallelism occurs, and unsplit it when the parallelism is 
  finished (i.e. dynamically growing and losing \"heads\").
  The @io-streams@ library is used for all stream inputs.
